Spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum. Poop in the plant pot eat the fat cats food howl uncontrollably for no reason. Chirp at birds hide head under blanket so no one can see so attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim under the bed, yet attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened pee in the shoe.
